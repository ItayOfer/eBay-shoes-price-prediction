## Welcome

Welcome to the eBay shoes' price prediction task!

Me and my friend Yoni, used the attached dataset to predict different prices of various shoes that had been web-scraped from eBay.

## Walkthrough

You can find here the model itself, and a PDF file named ["Modelling"](https://github.com/ItayOfer/eBay-shoes-price-prediction/blob/main/Modelling.pdf) which explains by detail every step of our modelling procedure.

## The result
